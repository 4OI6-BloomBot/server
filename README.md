# BloomBot Server


## About
This repository is for the server that manages the data generated by the BloomBot buoy. 

## Setup
[Install](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) Python and pip, then install Django and the required packages.

```python
python -m pip install django
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[Install](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) PostgreSQL.
You will also have to create the user and database in PostgreSQL for Django. Steps for this can be found [here](https://djangocentral.com/using-postgresql-with-django/).


## Usage
Django has a built-in development server. After starting the server, navigate to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser. More information on the limitations of the dev server can be found [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/tutorial01/#the-development-server).

```python
python manage.py runserver
```

## Changes
The main branch is protected from direct writes, ideally create a new branch to work in then merge it in with a pull request when ready.
CI is run on pull requests to check if everything compiles correctly.
